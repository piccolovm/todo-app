Hey Piccolo,
I hope you are doing good. but fir bhi kaise ho? sach wala batao...like everything.
I really miss you a lot all the time. Your voice, your txts, calls, everything. Even though so many things happened and after these many months i m still in love(probably more) with you. I know things are difficult for you but nothing is happenening or happened for which we alredy didn't talk about. You know after few years, all this will be gone and only thing will be left will be our love. You will not crave for anything but love and would want to go back & change. Like i feel, if i could go back and change things. From the first time we felt for each other....i should have not stopped stopped myslef :(
That's y i m telling u that whatever u feeling now & trying to push me away is temporary. And if you think pushing me away would not ruin my life then you are very wrong. If you would have asked me then i would have told u that how my life is going now without u and how much i feel happy being around u. i know things won't be same way like b4(anyways i hope someday it would), still we can't loose each other. The thing we have happens only once in a lifetime and we can't loose it bcz situation is not ideal. In every relationship, people face so many difficulties but if they face it together then they win that battle. Like once you said to me, don't give up on me, I am not going to give up on you & US. Love you more than anything.

Tell me your feelings idiot, i wanna know. Whatever it is, whatever you have not shared yet.
Write to me idiot, whenever you can...you are my strenght idiot.
